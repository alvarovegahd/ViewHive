# ViewHive v0.9.1

ViewHive is a project to periodically record videos at scheduled times and save them to external USB storage. The file is saved as a H.264 video playable with VLC.

Scheduled recoring times are set with a remote while an OLED display shows the menus and inputs. After a period of inactivity, the camera shuts down to conserve battery, only starting up to record or after pressing the power switch.
