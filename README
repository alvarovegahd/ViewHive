Bee Camera v0.5.3 README
==========

Python script to record video on a Raspberry Pi and save to external USB storage as an mp4. Recording begins at startup. Time setting and recording settings will soon be set by IR remote.

Uses:
Raspberry Pi (Debian)
Python 3
WittyPi
MP4Bbox
(LIRC next)


Issues
Cron doesn't run after wittyPi scheduled startup (using a bash script in /boot instead)
WittyPi doesn't keep time after an interuption and shutdown (testing alternative schedule.wpi formats)
Camera script may create a duplicate BEEVIDS folder which would have to be removed (delaying write function for now)


CRONTAB script (not in use due to wittyPi)
@reboot ifdown wlan0
@reboot sh /home/pi/Documents/Python\ 3\ Projects/Bee\ Camera/launcher.sh >/home/pi/Documents/Python\ 3\ Projects/Bee\ Camera/logs/cronlog 2>&1
