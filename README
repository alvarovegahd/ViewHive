Bee Camera v0.5.2 README

Python script to record video on a Raspberry Pi and save to external USB storage as an mp4.

Uses:
Python 3
crontab
WittyPi

Issues
Auto run can't find USB storage:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cameraBEES.py", line 37, in <module>
    shutil.copy(srcroot, dstroot)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/shutil.py", line 119, in copy
    copyfile(src, dst)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/shutil.py", line 83, in copyfile
    with open(dst, 'wb') as fdst:
IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/media/pi/BEEVIDS/'


TODO
Fix shutil.copy issue (delay operation until media appears?)
Adjust video overlay (elapsed time)
Create GUI to set record time without openning code
